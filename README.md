# UESkeletonRenamer
Python script for Unreal Engine 5. Renames the skeleton of skeletal meshes to match a unified Synty Skeleton.
Currently only adds missing IK Bones as well as Jaw Bone. Renames _ik to ik and removes all bones not matching source in the end, if bRemoveBones = true.
USAGE AT OWN RISK. MAKE A BACKUP!
